# Bing Wallpaper (C++)

A lightweight replacement for the official Bing Wallpaper app.
This tray application is written in C++ (Win32 API). It downloads the daily Bing wallpaper (using Bingâ€™s public API), saves it, and sets it as your Windows desktop wallpaper automatically.   

Runs silently in the system tray with classic Bing icon.  
Automatically updates the wallpaper once per day.  

Provides rightâ€‘click menu from system tray:
- Update Now
- Start with Windows
- Exit
