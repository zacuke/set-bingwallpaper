# Bing Wallpaper (C++)

A lightweight replacement for the official Bing Wallpaper app.  
This tray application is written in **C++ (Win32 API)**. It downloads the daily Bing wallpaper (using Bingâ€™s public API), saves it, and sets it as your Windows desktop wallpaper automatically.  

It runs in the system tray with classic bing icon and provides a rightâ€‘click menu to **Update Now** or **Exit**.
